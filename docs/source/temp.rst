What is Kithara?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Kithara** is a lightweight library offering building blocks and recipes for tuning popular open source LLMs like Llama 3 and Gemma 2 on Google TPUs.

Kithara makes post-training easier to do on TPUs.  Post-training algorithms include continued pretraining, fine-tuning, PEFT, RLHF, and quantization. These algorithms adapt a pre-trained language model to a specific task or domain by training it on a custom dataset. Using TPUs provides significant advantages in terms of performance, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, enabling faster training times and the ability to work with larger models and datasets.
